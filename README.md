<details><summary>Over 25 years of experience developing websites, web applications and mobile applications, mostly in Typescript using React and NodeJS.</summary>

I have over 25 years experience developing websites, web applications and mobile applications. My
recent roles have been developing client-side and server-side applications in Typescript using React
and NodeJS. Combined with my knowledge of databases like Postgres and MySQL, I deliver high-quality
software that drives business success.

<details><summary>Considered a "git wizard" by colleagues, with extensive experience in advanced Git workflows and CI/CD.</summary>

I have given company wide talks on the git version control
system. I have written pre-commit hooks to check code for linting errors before committing and worked
on a tool to eliminate merge conflicts caused by linting fixes to a codebase. I have written a tool
to find the last place in history that on old branch will rebase to without conflicts, which often
makes resolving rebase conflicts easier. I've used git as a front end to svn in an svn-only company
using the git-svn plugin which enabled me to manage my versions and commits locally then merge them
centrally when they were tested and ready.

I know my way around Github and Gitlab's CI services, including advanced configurations that ran
different kinds of tests depending on different triggers and tests that contribute code back to the
original repository. I have also used CircleCI, AWS Codebuild, Travis and Jenkins in the past. I have
made a small [contribution](https://github.com/mislav/hub/pull/2704) to the original github "hub"
command to fix a bug when a single commit has a large number of CI jobs.

<details><summary>Fan of configuration as code, including developing tools for Redash BI server configuration and Bitfocus Companion.</summary>

I like to ensure all configuration is managed as code and tracked in source control. I've written a
[tool](https://github.com/rjmunro/redash-loader) to extract the query and dashboard configuration
from a Redash BI server and store it as a series of YAML, SQL and JSON files that can be committed to
git, allowing the state to be tracked, branched and reverted. It can also be loaded into other
Redash instances running similar databases in different locations. I wrote the YAML import/export
features in [Bitfocus companion](https://github.com/bitfocus/companion) to help us manage the A/V
and streaming setup at my church.

I have recent experience managing dependencies with npm and yarn for Javascript/Typescript and
poetry for python. I have also used Ruby's bundler and PHP's composer.

I have managed docker containers, optimising built containers to contain only the runtime binaries
without the build tools. I've used docker-compose to orchestrate containers.

<details><summary>Experienced with Agile practices and collaboration to find innovative solutions.</summary>

I'm experienced with Agile working practises and have led planning, retrospective and daily stand up
meetings. I enjoy working with product owners to find innovative solutions that improve customer
experience at the same time as streamlining development.

#### Hobbies and Community Contributions

<details><summary>Extensive volunteer experience in audio-visual operations.</summary>

In my spare time I have a volunteered in audio-visual operation since I was a young teenager. I have
about 20 years experience about once a month as a sound engineer, but I now mostly direct and vision
mix live multi-camera video for our
[church YouTube Live streams](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKlHRaG4bStPTVxcHOPBFfEOPlX9hHDWl)
and IMAG (Image MAGnification - i.e. the screens for the congregation in the room).

</details>

<details><summary>Significant contributions to open-source data.</summary>

I've contributed extensively in the early days of MusicBrainz, OpenStreetMap and Stack overflow.
